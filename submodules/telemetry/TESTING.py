README BEFORE USING
Telemetry's __init__.py must be changed in several places before using this.

* The reference to the config file in dump()'s while loop must be changed to a number, not referencing config.
* radio_output.send() in the dump() method must be changed with a print statement.
    Alternatively, radio_output.send() can be changed similarly.
* Command_ingest.enqueue() should be commented out or replaced with a dummy thing.
* The two lines at the end of start() that start the decide() thread should be commented out, and the while-True
    loop in decide() must be commented out. Indents need to be fixed accordingly.
    This script runs decide() as a one-off method

"""

"""
A script to test telemetry. Changes must be made as above before using.
When "ready" is printed, type any one of:

* ee - enqueue an error
* el - enqueue a log
* eXXX where XXX is any text that begins with a semicolon - run telemetry.enqueue(XXX)
* d - run a dump
* p - print the general queue, error stack, and log stack in that order
* c - clear buffers
